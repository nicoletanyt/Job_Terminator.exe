            "question": "Careful dieting is the most important part of a healthy life. Discuss.",
            "answer": "Dieting is often associated with weight loss and restriction, but it is also about making conscious and informed choices about the foods we eat. A healthy diet is a crucial aspect of overall health and well-being, as the foods we consume provide the necessary nutrients and energy to fuel our bodies. One of the main reasons why careful dieting is so important is that it helps to prevent over-eating and the associated health risks. Consuming too many calories can lead to weight gain, which in turn increases the risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and certain cancers. By paying attention to portion sizes and making informed choices about the foods we eat, we can help to control our calorie intake and maintain a healthy weight. In addition to controlling calorie intake, careful dieting also involves avoiding certain foods that can be harmful to our health. Processed foods high in sugar, saturated fats, and salt can increase the risk of chronic diseases, and should be consumed in moderation. On the other hand, including a variety of nutrient-dense foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins and healthy fats are important for maintaining a balanced diet. Another important aspect of careful dieting is being mindful of liquid intake. Consuming excessive amounts of alcohol and sugary drinks can contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of chronic diseases. Instead, it is recommended to consume water, low-fat milk, or unsweetened beverages, which are healthier options. Another consideration when it comes to dieting is the choice of vegetarian or vegan diets. These diets can be healthy and nutritionally sound, but they may require more planning and attention to ensure that all essential nutrients are being consumed. Some health conditions may also require a controlled diet, such as allergies or food intolerances. While dieting plays a crucial role in maintaining good health, it is important to be aware of the dangers of over-dieting, such as eating disorders. Such conditions can have severe physical and mental health consequences and should be avoided. Factors such as disease, exercise, and medical treatment can also affect the diet and must be considered. Overall, careful dieting is just one aspect of a healthy life. A healthy diet plays a crucial role in maintaining good health, but it is also important to consider other elements of overall health and well-being such as physical activity, mental health, and emotional well-being. A balanced lifestyle, which includes a healthy diet, regular physical activity, and positive mental health, is the key to achieving and maintaining good health. In conclusion, a healthy diet is crucial for overall health and well-being, and careful dieting plays a vital role in this. By making conscious and informed choices about the foods we eat, we can help to control our calorie intake, avoid harmful foods and maintain a balanced diet. However, it is important to be aware of the dangers of over-dieting, and to consider other elements of a healthy life such as mental health and emotional well-being. Therefore, careful dieting is an important part of a healthy life, but it should not be the only focus."

            "question": "The digital book is never likely to replace the printed one. How far do you agree?",
            "answer": "Digital books, also known as e-books, have become increasingly popular in recent years with the rise of digital technology and the convenience of reading on screens. However, the question remains whether digital books will ever fully replace their printed counterparts. One of the main advantages of digital books is their portability. With the ability to store thousands of books on a single device, e-books eliminate the need for carrying heavy physical books. This is particularly useful for travelers, students, and professionals who need to carry a large number of books with them on the go. Additionally, digital books can also be easily accessed by people with visual impairments through text-to-speech technology. On the other hand, despite the availability of digital options, print media continues to persist. Bookstores and libraries remain popular, and there are many people who prefer the physical sensation of holding a book in their hands and flipping through its pages. Additionally, reading a physical book may cause less eye strain and is considered more suitable for young children who are still learning to read. Another aspect that is often overlooked is the art of publishing. Printed books often include illustrations, photographs, and other design elements that enhance the reading experience. These elements may be lost in an e-book, which may not have the same impact on the reader. Furthermore, the cost of an electronic device to read e-books on, such as a Kindle or tablet, may be out of reach for some individuals. This can be a barrier for some people who may not be able to afford such technology. Additionally, the type of book or document can also play a role in the preference for either a digital or a printed version. For example, reference books and cookbooks may be preferred in print format for ease of use, while novels and other fiction may be preferred in digital format for portability. In conclusion, while digital books have become more popular in recent years, it is unlikely that they will fully replace printed books. Both digital and printed books have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference and the type of book or document. While digital books offer convenience and portability, printed books offer a unique reading experience that cannot be replicated by a digital device."

            "question": "Censorship of the arts can never be justified. Discuss.",
            "answer": "Censorship of the arts refers to the suppression or prohibition of any parts of books, films, music, and other forms of creative expression by governments, religious organizations, and other groups or individuals. The issue of censorship in the arts is a complex and highly debated one, with valid arguments on both sides. One argument in favor of censorship is the need to protect the public from allegedly tasteless or offensive works of art. Governments and other organizations may believe that certain forms of expression, such as graphic violence or sexual content, can be harmful to certain individuals or groups. Additionally, censorship can be used to prevent the spread of hate speech or other forms of harmful expression. Another argument in favor of censorship is the concern of government and religious organizations about political messages that are perceived to undermine society. Governments may wish to prevent the spread of ideas that could incite violence or destabilize the country. Similarly, religious organizations may feel that certain forms of expression are blasphemy or immoral, and should be suppressed. On the other hand, censorship of the arts can also be seen as a violation of the right to freedom of expression. The arts are a fundamental expression of the human spirit, and should not be suppressed or censored by authorities. Moreover, the arts can also play a vital role in challenging society and its norms. Artistic works can raise awareness on important issues and serve as a catalyst for social and political change. Another critical point to consider is the question of who should be in charge of censorship and who they are accountable to. In many cases, censorship is imposed by governments or other powerful entities, which can lead to the suppression of dissenting voices and the promotion of a particular agenda. Additionally, censorship can also have a negative impact on minority groups, as it can be used to silence marginalized voices and prevent them from being heard. Furthermore, changing social and moral attitudes over time can also affect what is considered acceptable for censorship. What may be considered offensive or controversial today may be accepted as mainstream tomorrow. In conclusion, censorship of the arts is a complex issue with valid arguments on both sides. While censorship can be used to protect the public from allegedly tasteless or offensive works of art, it can also be used to suppress dissenting voices and prevent the spread of ideas that could incite violence or destabilize the country. The arts are a fundamental expression of the human spirit and should not be suppressed, but the question of who should be in charge of censorship, who are they accountable to, and how to balance the right to freedom of expression with the need to protect society is a challenging one."

            "question": "Poetry is irrelevant in the modern world. To what extent do you agree?",
            "answer": "Poetry, a form of literature that uses figurative language and creative expressions to convey emotions and ideas, has been a part of human culture for centuries. However, some argue that poetry is irrelevant in the modern world. This statement has both valid points and counterarguments. One of the main reasons why poetry may be considered relevant in the modern world is the integral role it plays in its literary and cultural heritage. Poetry has been a significant part of human history and has played an important role in shaping society and culture. Many poets have been celebrated for their contributions to literature, and their works continue to be studied and appreciated today. Poetry can be found in many forms of literature, such as poetry collections, novels, and plays. Additionally, there is a strong relationship between poetry and popular modern music forms such as rap, hip-hop, and spoken word. These forms of music often use poetic devices, such as metaphor and imagery, and have gained a wide audience among young people. Poetry and music have a close relationship as both forms of art can express emotions and ideas in a creative way. Furthermore, nursery rhymes and rhyme continue to be popular as tools for educating children, which in itself is a form of poetry. Moreover, Poetic devices are often used in literature, and it is an essential feature of language and literature for appreciation and study. The eternal themes and emotions expressed in poetry, such as love, loss, and hope, remain relevant in the modern world. Poetry serves as a means to demonstrate creativity and freedom of expression. In poetry, one can express personal feelings, thoughts and emotions in a creative way that can be shared with others. However, some argue that poetry is seen as a niche pursuit in comparison with other art forms such as film, television, and music. Furthermore, poets may experience difficulty in selling their work, which could discourage aspiring writers. Poetry is not as widely read as fiction or non-fiction, and it can be difficult for poets to find a substantial readership. Additionally, poetry is not as popular as other forms of entertainment, such as video games or streaming services. In conclusion, Poetry is relevant in the modern world. While it may not be as popular as other art forms, it plays an important role in literary and cultural heritage. Poetry has a strong relationship with popular modern music forms and continues to be used as a tool for educating children. Additionally, Poetic devices are essential features of language and literature for appreciation and study. The eternal themes and emotions expressed in poetry remain relevant in the modern world. Poetry serves as a means to demonstrate creativity and freedom of expression, and it can be used as a powerful tool for self-expression and communication. However, it is important to consider the limitations and difficulties that poets may face in selling their work, which could discourage aspiring writers. Despite these limitations, poetry remains a valuable form of art that can be appreciated and studied by many. Poetry has the power to evoke emotions, inspire thought, and connect people across time and space."

            "question": "I believe everyone should now be forced by law to recycle. What is your opinion? Give reasons and examples to support your view.",
            "answer": "The world is facing an environmental crisis. People are increasingly aware of the consequences of climate change and the need to reduce our environmental impact. One of the primary ways to do this is to recycle. Recycling is the process of collecting, sorting, and processing materials for reuse. It is widely accepted that recycling has many benefits, including reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill, conserving natural resources, and reducing the energy used in manufacturing. However, the question of whether everyone should be forced by law to recycle is a more complex one. In this essay, I will argue that, while there are a number of benefits to mandatory recycling, it should not be enforced by law. One argument in favour of mandatory recycling is that it would be a more effective way of reducing the amount of waste sent to landfill. Landfills are a major source of air and water pollution, and recycling can significantly reduce their environmental impact. Furthermore, it would be a more cost-effective solution than other methods of waste disposal, such as incineration. Mandatory recycling would also help to conserve natural resources, as recycled materials can be used to create new products, thus reducing the need to extract new resources from the environment. Despite these benefits, there are also some drawbacks to mandatory recycling. Firstly, it would require significant resources to implement and enforce. This could involve funding and personnel, as well as the development of new infrastructure, such as sorting and processing plants. It is also worth noting that, while recycling does reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill, it does not necessarily reduce overall levels of waste. This is because many people will simply replace thrown-away items with new ones, rather than reusing or repurposing them. In addition, there are some ethical considerations around mandatory recycling. It can be argued that it is wrong to force people to do something they may not want to do, and that recycling should be a matter of personal choice. There is also the risk that mandatory recycling could lead to a ‘nanny state’, whereby the government has too much control over the way people live their lives. In conclusion, mandatory recycling should not be enforced by law. Recycling is a complex issue, and there are a number of benefits and drawbacks to consider. While recycling does have the potential to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfill, conserve natural resources, and reduce energy costs, it is also important to take into account the resources needed to implement and enforce mandatory recycling, as well as the ethical considerations involved. It is my belief that recycling should be a personal choice, and that the government should focus on incentivising and educating people, rather than forcing them to do it."

            "question": "It was my proudest moment. Write about a time when you felt like this.",
            "answer": "I was the last speaker to deliver my speech in the room. Our school team sat just a meter or so away, so nervous I could physically feel anxiety radiating from them. Every painful hour of training we submitted ourselves to was for this moment. So far, it had gone well: we had trounced so many of the so-called elite debate teams, cementing our status as the underdog. No one expected a team of seemingly-quiet girls to have come this far, but here we were, in the finals, against a team that had won the championship for ten years in a row. Our coach held our hands tightly as we walked towards the lecture theatre where the results would be announced, reassuring us that we did well, and that accomplishing a guaranteed silver medal was still good enough. However, secretly in our heart of hearts, we hoped we would take the gold. Otherwise, what was all that training for? I was so nervous I kept quiet, feeling the sweat trickle down the back of the school’s formal uniform that was set apart for only students who participate in the most prestigious competitions. My tie suddenly felt tight and uncomfortable, but I did not dare to loosen it and sully our image. Walking into the blessed air-conditioning of the lecture theatre, we sat down and awaited our fate. Unfortunately, we were seated next to our competitors, who kept pointing at us and laughing condescendingly, as if they were expecting the win. “And the winner of the Singapore Debating Championships is…” He trailed off into silence but I swore you could hear our collective hearts pounding in sheer anxiety. When he cried out our school name, I could not even react. It was like an absolute dream when everyone started bursting into tears of joy, while I stared, stunned, until I finally realised what happened. We won. The underdogs won. We, the quiet, unassuming team that had just barely made it to this high-level division via the qualifiers won. Our competitors looked disgusted and refused to shake our hands, choosing instead to cast us looks of disdain. It was then my team and I stepped forward with courage we never knew we had, and turned around to face our opponents. “You will display proper gentlemanly behaviour and sportsmanship, or you will forever be known as bad losers,” I managed to say, as politely as I could, even though I wanted to scream inside me. Staring them directly in the eye even though I was at least a head shorter than them, I refused to break my gaze. Finally, they looked away, then embarrassedly stuck out their hands. That was when I felt the proudest of myself and of my team. It was not the gold medal that went around our necks, not the championship trophy that we got to bring home, but the act of standing up against people who truly believed we would not make it. We had struggled through so much to make it this far and we deserved that respect. Even though we had to demand it, I still proudly reached out and shook their hands. From that day on, we would not just be known for our debating prowess, but for the fact that even though we seemed like pushovers, we were incredibly strong. Our gold medals shone brightly under the lights, but our faces and spirits shone ever brighter."

            "question": "Write a story in which you disobeyed an order.",
            "answer": "The camp had never been as crowded as it was on that day which dawned crisp and clear. I had never witnessed so much chaos that erupted due to the convocation of the arriving troops. This was because our village was under attack by a rival party, and our soldiers were summoned to prevent further loss of lives. This was the only thing that we could do at the moment – abide by the orders given to us. Ryan, our leader, was a tall dark man who possessed fierce looks. He assembled me and Jimmy in his office and, we rushed to meet him. Unlike other days, we had to clear multiple security checks because dozens of Seraphites penetrated our camps. Seraphites were the people of our rival squad but, Ryan called them “Scars”. Therefore, everyone followed his expression due to the simultaneous feelings of fear and respect. Ryan’s office was as usually dark, and it was like a place out of time. The smoke of the cigarette occupied the entire room with its offensive, eye-watering and stale odour. “Joel and Jimmy, do not leave the camp at any cost. The scars have their traps all around”, he said. We nodded and enquired about our future plans. However, the blaring sounds of disarray disturbed our conversation. “Go check out what the matter is. I am expecting Chris and Karl back to the camp soon”, Ryan said in an optimistic manner. I dashed out where I glanced at some soldiers dragging a body towards Ryan’s room. I lifted the muddy black fabric from the face, and it was Karl. “Chris has killed him! We will make that traitor pay for this”, one of the sobbing soldiers commented. I was in utter disbelief because Chris and Karl had served our village for decades and therefore, I could not comprehend one being a traitor. “I have to get to the bottom of the issue”, I said in a hustle. My ally Jimmy urged me to stop and not disobey Ryan’s order of not leaving the camp. I was determined to reach out to Chris, and I even knew about his whereabouts. This was because he was entrusted an assignment to our previous hide-out. Nonetheless, Jimmy helped me egress from the camp from the Southern door because the number of troops was minimal over here. I confidently marched towards the East to confront Chris, but after twenty minutes of hectic sprinting, I became more cautious. Unfortunately, one of the traps of Scars caught me as my left foot was trapped in a metalled cage (like structure). I was surrounded by numerous Scars within a fraction of seconds who had their heads shaved and eyebrows removed, and they were honestly terrifying. They referred to us (the people of my camp) as “Wolves” and one of them said: “We need to get rid of him. He has an idea where we are camping”. I took a deep breath and my nose caught the most horrible odour ever. The smell was terrible – it could even get a beast on its feet. But, I was more concerned about my life as it flashed before my eyes. The muscles in my body screamed at me to flee, but the cage kept me frozen. My intensifying breaths came to a halt for a while when I started to hear distant gunshots. These disturbing sounds caught the attention of most of the Scars, who departed in fragments to come across the matter. This was the time when I grabbed out my knife, which I concealed, and struck the cage with intense force until the lock pierced into pieces. With this, I instantly broke into a sprint and multiple Scars started to chase me. The colour of my pale face was draining, and my legs were losing their energy and potential to run. However, half a mile forward, Jimmy appeared who diverted their route. Exhausted, I arrived at the door of the camp where Ryan was standing with his wide-open glaring eyes and tightly closed lips. I wanted to explain but he yelled in an uncontrollable manner: “You disobeyed me for that traitor? I also want to know why he did that to his close friend, Karl.” Simultaneously, he struck sharply at my face with intense force from his hands and ordered me to get locked. I was anxious about my punishment but even more worried about Chris. My mind was bombarded with questions such as, “Why did he commit this crime? What if he is innocent? What punishment will the camp decide for him, and for me?” I sobbed in the cell which gradually escalated."

            "question": "Write about an occasion when an inconsiderate act leads to drastic consequences.",
            "answer": "“Bang, bang, bang, buzzzzz,” the sound of the relentless pounding of the drill reverberated throughout the walls of my flat. The cacophonous sound had jolted me from my deep slumber. Bleary-eyed, I dragged myself towards the main door, hoping to find out who or what is causing such a din. I opened my door and was livid to find that the entire common corridor has been filled with tools, wooden planks, stacks of old newspaper and old furniture. A long extension ladder was also placed against the parapet. It turns out that my new neighbour Dashen has been using the common corridor like his own workshop. “Oh my gosh! Can you please STOP?!” I yelled, my voice shooting up 50 octaves, my eyes flashing angrily. “Why are you making so much noise so early in the morning? Don’t you know you cannot block the common corridor? You are obstructing everyone. This is very inconsiderate!” I hollered again. Rage gripping me and anger flooding through my veins. Dashen darted me a baleful look, flicked his cigarette, turned his head, walked back into his flat, ignoring me completely. At this point, I could feel a vein popped out in my neck, my jaw thrust forward with indignation. I stomped back to my room to put on some proper clothing so that I can confront him. Suddenly, an acrid smell hit my nostrils. It was smoky campfire-ish smell. I raced to the front door only to find thick gray smoke billowing in. Like a monstrous beast, it wolfed everything in its way. Nothing was spared. Flames ripped across the ceiling as if they had been shot from a flamethrower. At the corner of my eyes, I caught a glimpse of a burning cigarette that landed on the pile of newspaper. Immediately, everything clicked. Our inconsiderate new neighbour, Dashen, must have flung his cigarette onto the newspapers that he had left outside. The cigarette must have stabbed into a tottering stack of cardboard boxes intermixed with old newspapers and an old cabinet that was missing a leg. The suffocating smoke jolted me to my senses. I quickly reached for my phone and dialled 995. As I put down the phone, a thought struck me like lightning. Oh no! I have to alert Auntie Wong, our recently widowed, octogenarian neighbour who is living alone. I knocked furiously and frantically at her door. Just as I thought, she was home and had just woken up too. “We have to get out of here! There is a fire!” I bellowed. Mrs Wong was hyperventilating. I took her hand and helped her out of her flat. There was choking smoke, so black and thick that it seemed you could grab it by the handful. Suddenly, out of nowhere, I heard a lot sound. Crack! Thud! The ladder that Dashen left outside the corridor had fallen, landing on Mrs Wong’s left leg. Gasping for breath, I mustered all my strength and pushed the ladder away, almost tripping over the debris. I picked the frail Mrs Wong up and carried her down the stairs. Just as we were able to go down the stairs, a loud boom echoed behind me and we were hurled forward. At this point, the firemen had arrived and managed to bring the both of us to safety. After battling with the fire for close to four hours, the fire was finally extinguished. The police had also arrived and told us that there some flammable substances such as cleaning agents and electronic items in the old cabinet that Dashen had left outside the corridor. Dashen was also questioned by the authorities and the police took him away to assist with further investigation. Dashen’s terribly selfish, horribly reckless act endangered everyone. Lives could have been lost because of such thoughtless act and careless oversights. Dashen’s inconsiderate act has started a disastrous fire which took have taken a heavy toll on innocent lives."

            "question": "Write about a time you caused great disappointment to another person.",
            "answer": "'Son, why is the door faulty?' Mother said as she narrowed her eyes at me. 'I… I… I do not know. But I could have jammed it while you all were away for your Bali vacation,' I stuttered while wiping the pearly beads of sweat from my glistening forehead. Father growled, 'I think not, boy! Something is fishy about this. Why does my gut feeling tell me maybe someone you had invited over broke the door? I wonder how could that person be so careless to order 12 boxes of pizza, eat up 8 of my best cuts of beef, and leave 15 beer bottles in the trash can?' Like a prowling lion circling his terrified prey, Father snarled and started pacing towards me, with a belt in hand. I trembled violently and desperately tried to recall. The 15th of November. That awaited date. It was the date which my parents and I were eagerly anticipating. The day my parents were leaving for a week-long Bali vacation. The day where I would have the entire house to myself. The day which I would have a whole week worth of partying. The night where sleep would be nonexistent. I was like a child awaiting Christmas, full of life, hope, and anticipation. The very week before the party, I sent out countless invitations – to my primary school friends, secondary school friends, and even tuition mates – inviting them to my very first house party. Preparations were underway, makeshift beds were ready, a big-budget was made. What could possibly go wrong? Soon after, the much-anticipated date arrived. Upon bidding my parents adieu and safe trip, I called my buddies and gave them the all-clear sign. Moments later, the bunch arrived and we started setting up for the big night ahead. Stereos and sleeping arrangements were organized, dinner was ordered, the Playstation was online. Jason, my best friend, screamed, 'Let the game begin!' The snacks were displayed, filling up four tables, giving us a plethora to pick from. Drinks were like free-flow, never-ending nor ceasing. To be honest, the first three days passed us by like a breeze. It was only on the fourth day did I finally understand the bitter truth behind the phrase, 'Time flies when you are having fun.' The fifth day was the day in which we finally got hold of our immature drunken selves and realized that we were wasted away. Scanning the room, I gaped in horror at the horrendous sight before me. Honestly, I was petrified. Before my eyes was a wasteland, an aftermath of a drunken food fight coupled with a dumping ground. Pizza slices were stuck to the ceiling, boxes of uneaten food and beverages were completely infested with insects. Liquor spilt all over the sofa, fabric on the upholstery was shredded, as though a drunken murderer was going on a rampage. Shrieking in horror and in disbelief, I screamed, 'Stop! Stop it right now!' Shocked at my crazed tone, my friends complied and slowly but surely, took in the putrid and disgusting sight before them. All they tried to comprehend what had happened to my once pristine and spotless living room. I instantly barked out orders for them to straighten and clean up the room. However, when I struggled to open my parched lips, I belched out a repulsive stench. It smelt as though something had crawled up into my mouth and died in it. I was mortified. Nevertheless, I braved my own stinking breath and continued giving out orders and slowly restored the room to its former glory. 'Time waits for no one.' That was the very phrase that spurred me on to get the house cleaned. It was better for me to get the house in order earlier than to wait for the very last hour. My friends and I were like ants on the run. We were as frantic as could be, rapidly scuttling around, trying to clear the mess as quickly as possible. We rushed to repair all the damage done to the house and cleared the house of all the garbage. Time was our predator, its gnashing jaws were repetitively pounding, 'Tick Tock, Tick Tock' into our ears. Adrenaline rushed in. Our hearts were throbbing non-stop. Furtive glances were constantly made towards the driveway. My parents had an uncanny obsession with turning up early for everything. 'God forbid that they return a day earlier,' I murmured. Thankfully, we got the job done. Muscles aching, tongues out, and panting, shivering away, we were like dogs after a fierce race. Our breathing was laborious. We squeezed the eyes shut, then opened them wide in an effort to stay awake, as we toppled down to the ground in exhaustion. We were safe. Or so I thought… Tossed back to the cruel reality, I blinked and shrieked,' Wait! Wait! I… I… I can explain!' Words started pouring out from my mouth in a torrential flow. Seeing the disappointed look in my parents’ eyes terrified me and I did not dare to fathom what my punishment would be like. The mere thought of it made me tremble and shake like a leaf in a hurricane. 'Why? Why did you disobey us? Why can’t we trust you?' Mother questioned softly. It broke my heart upon hearing those soft but heart-wrenching words. I had abused my trust my parents had for me, tossed it away for nothing and disregarded all their love for me. At that moment, I finally realized. Was that act of willful disobedience worth the hurt and disappointed look on both my parents? It was not the words that hurt me the most, but it was Mother’s soft and teary expression which shattered me. Hands falling to the side, and tears welling up in my eyes, I let out a mournful and soul-wrenching sob, 'I’m sorry'. Shaking her head softly, Mother stood up and left the room. Breathing in heavily, Father whispered, 'We forgive you, Jason. Your mother and I think highly of you and you can still regain our trust. I am sure that you can prove to us that you can be trusted. Don’t just do it for me, do it for your Mother. She believes in you too.” Holding back hot tears and sniffling rapidly, I whispered, 'I won’t let you two down again.'"

            "question": "Describe a place which means a great deal to you. Why is it so important?",
            "answer": "My grandmother's home - this is the place which means a great deal to me. After a long day at school, I enjoy visiting my grandmother’s home to catch up with her and talk about my day. The four-room HDB flat situated at Yishun has been beautifully decorated by my grandmother herself. The bright yellow painted walls and white tiles complement each other well. The living room is decorated nicely with curtains sewn by my grandmother. The comfy HDB flat holds many memories for me.  Growing up with two working parents, my sister and I spent a lot of time together at our grandmother’s home. Our parents would drop us off at our grandmother’s home at 7 in the morning before leaving for work. My sister and I would then sleep until it was time to get ready for school. My sister and I used to argue a lot. However, being at our grandmother’s home taught both of us to be patient with each other and to always be there for one another. There were many times when my sister and I threw tantrums and slammed doors at each other’s faces but we learnt to forgive and learn from our mistakes. The very same place my sister and I argued a lot was also the place we first told each other our secrets. My sister, being the older one, advised me many times and became my listening ear whenever I needed someone to talk to. We bonded a lot through all the highs and lows we experienced as siblings whilst staying at my grandmother’s home.  Not only that, my grandmother’s home was where I first baked for the very first time. My grandmother is a very talented woman. She knows how to cook up a storm for celebrations like Hari Raya Puasa, sew different kinds of clothes and bake many different types of cookies. My grandmother also has a curry puff business. She enjoys making curry puffs and sells them for a living at a local convenience store. So naturally, being at my grandmother’s home led me to learn how to bake. As a young child, I was very interested to know how to bale traditional Hari Raya cookies. My grandmother willingly taught me how to bake ‘Kueh Suji’ with a simple recipe that has been passed down from generation to generation. My first baking experience was very enjoyable and I was delighted when my family members loved the ‘kueh’. From then on, I would bake together with my grandmother at her home before Hari Raya Puasa.   Lastly, my grandmother’s home means a great deal to me because it is where my childhood friends and I played many different games and bonded with one another. My grandmother used to conduct religious classes to children living in the neighbourhood. At that point of time, I was only eight years old. The children who attended the classes were aged between six to twelve years old. As there were a lot of children, the waiting line took a while. The children who were waiting in line would gather outside and I would join them to play different games. I would always look forward to seeing them as I enjoyed their company and loved the fun times together. Although all of us are much older now and do not really see each other often, I will always be reminded of them and the memories made every time I visit my grandmother’s home.  I am grateful for my special place. That place serves as a symbol of my childhood and all the memories I made whilst I was there. My grandmother’s home is neither big nor grand but I am grateful to have a place that will always be special to me and remembered in my heart."

            "question": "Describe an event you looked forward to which turned out to be disappointing. Explain why you were excited and why it did not live up to your expectations.",
            "answer": "As I gradually stood up, I could hear the huge round of applause by the audience. People were chanting my name, “Jayanth..Jayanth”. This was a moment that I lived for and thoroughly enjoyed the stardom. I swiftly turned ninety degrees left and briskly started walking when I suddenly heard a loud thud. Unwarranted pain slowly inched over me. It felt as if I had succumbed to the ground.  I opened my eyes and alas, realised that this was just a dream. A dream, which I hoped will come true. I had my first solo guitar performance coming up in less than a week. I had practiced months just to perform a two minute piece. I made sure I mastered my timing, tempo, chords and transition between chords. Intense practice sessions with my instructor and countless number of times playing it in front of my parents, I was working as hard as I could. This was not only a performance, it was also my examination for me to reach the next grade and I had to ace it.  All my friends and family were attending this event which also had other performances like the piano and the ukulele. I was really looking forward to playing in the event and exhibiting my skills. As the day was approaching, my enthusiasm grew exponentially. In school, I chuntered on about my upcoming performance and how much I had endeavoured for it like a broken recorder.  Finally, the day arrived. I was eagerly waiting in the backstage, thinking to myself on who would have come to support me. Just as how zest I was feeling,  I had butterflies in my stomach, lest I commit a mistake. The thought of it just made my hands shiver and legs flutter about. Perspiration trickled down my forehead. I decided to divert away from these thoughts and started practicing for the last time. My name was about to be called. Out of the blue, my left index finger, one of the relatively more important fingers to play the chords was scratched by the guitar strings and blood started oozing out. Fear creeped over me. This was the event I was so excited for and it seemed that it was the beginning of the end.  Needless to say, my performance was substandard and I blundered frequently. The eagle-eyed judges could pick even the slightest of mistakes made and now I was just making their job easier for them.  I had to retake the examination in the next performance and had dampened the spirits of my friends and family. I promised to myself that next time, I would not be too particular to over exert myself but rather keep a balance between practising the guitar and my other activities. This incident is etched in my mind and I would make sure to never repeat this again."
